<p>Sometimes the cheap item will just about do. If you want something that you will use just a few times on a single weekend and never use again, it might make sense to just buy a cheap one. For all other occasions buy the best you can afford. I<span style="font-weight: lighter;">s it good value to buy the best? I would argue that not buying the best you can afford is a false economy. Take for example, the North Face Sunspot sleeping bag. I have owned the same one for just over five years now and it has always provided me with good service. A friend of mine had the entry level (by which I mean cheap) version of this and in the last five years he was bought two of them. He is about to buy his third as the second one is barely serviceable. My expensive one (by which I mean good value for money) was not three times as expensive as the cheaper one. In fact it was not even twice as expensive.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">Well, that&rsquo;s the money argument addressed but there is a more important concern. What if the cheap item you have just bought is something on which you rely? For example, I always use the Petzl Mercury harness when I climb. Imagine climbing with a cheap version and worrying if you can depend on it when you really need it. Imagine having to explain an accident caused by using cheap gear. Imagine how you will explain to the relatives of somebody who was injured by your cheap gear. Imagine saying &ldquo;I am sorry about the injury but I did save a bit of money&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">Don&rsquo;t risk it. Use the best quality equipment you can afford.</span></p>
